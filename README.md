# meshlearn_models
Ready-to-use models trained using the ML pipeline in my [meshlearn repo](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/meshlearn).

See the README files in the respective model directory for details, and the documentation in the [meshlearn repo](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/meshlearn) for information on how to use these models in general.

The following models are available:

* [LightGBM model "v1"](./models/lightgbm/v1/)
* [LightGBM model "v2"](./models/lightgbm/v2/)

See the [meshlearn repo](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/meshlearn) for all other information, including license, author and documentation.
